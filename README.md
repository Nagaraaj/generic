# Web Coding Test
To get a sense of your coding style and approaches to issues, we'd like for you to design a small todo application.  You can use whatever technology stack you would like, but it should be web based. For example, we have had submissions using Spring Boot, ASP.NET MVC, LAMP, etc.  It does not need to persist across server restarts, so shoving it in memory will be fine.

### Minimum Requirements:
1. A todo should contain at least a description of what needs to be done.
1. Display the current set of todos in the todo list.
1. Edit a todo in the todo list.
1. Mark a todo from the todo list as done/remove the todo.

### Optional Requirements: 
1. Add the ability to mark all the todos done/remove all the todos.

### Submitting the code
1. Push your local changes to your remote repo (git push)
1. Create a Pull Request to master of this repo by clicking "Create Pull Request" in your forked repo.
